# Next-Word-Prediction-Model
Next Word Prediction means predicting the most likely word or phrase that will come next in a sentence or text. It is like having an inbuilt feature on an application that suggests the next word as you type or speak. The Next Word Prediction Models are used in applications like messaging apps, search engines, virtual assistants, and autocorrect features on smartphones. So, if you want to learn how to build a Next Word Prediction Model, this article is for you. In this article, I’ll take you through building a Next Word Prediction Model with Deep Learning using Python.
# What is the Next Word Prediction Model & How to Build it?
Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided.
The Next Word Prediction models have a range of applications across various industries. For example, when you start typing a message on your phone, it suggests the next word to speed up your typing. Similarly, search engines predict and show search suggestions as you type in the search bar. Next word prediction helps us communicate faster and more accurately by anticipating what we might say or search for.

To build a Next Word Prediction model:

    start by collecting a diverse dataset of text documents, 
    preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing it, 
    prepare the data by creating input-output pairs, 
    engineer features such as word embeddings, 
    select an appropriate model like an LSTM or GPT, 
    train the model on the dataset while adjusting hyperparameters,
    improve the model by experimenting with different techniques and architectures.

This iterative process allows businesses to develop accurate and efficient Next Word Prediction models that can be applied in various applications.

So the process of building a Next Word Prediction model starts by collecting textual data that can be a vocabulary for our model. For example, the way you type on your smartphone’s keyboard becomes the vocabulary of the next word prediction model of your smartphone’s keyboard
